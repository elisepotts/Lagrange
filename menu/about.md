**Hi, my Name is**  
Elise Marie Potts


**And I live in**  
Atlanta, GA


**I spend most of my day**  
designing fun, interactive games to build children’s social-emotional skills and empower them to be positive leaders in their schools and communities.


**I’ve been doing this for**  
5 years! 


**Because my passion is**  
inspiring children to become active, lifelong learners.
