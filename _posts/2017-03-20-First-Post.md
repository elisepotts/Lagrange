### Okay, I did it. 

I enrolled in Udacity’s VR Developer Nanodegree program. Currently, I’m a Curriculum Developer at a non-profit. I design research-based social-emotional learning (SEL) programs that empower kids to understand their own strengths and limitations, and ultimately grow up to be happy, healthy, and contributing members of society. I love what I do, but I’m ready to do it differently. I’m ready to unlearn and deprogram myself so I don’t stick to the same habits.

Unlearning is not about forgetting. It’s about choosing a different way of thinking. When we learn, we add new knowledge to what we already know. When we unlearn, we step outside of our mental model in order to choose differently. 

### As Albert Einstein once said...

So why VR? I’m interested in exploring new ways to teach social-emotional learning beyond the classroom walls. VR has the capacity to capture children’s attention and elevate traditional learning experiences.

The potential for thoughtful integration of VR and social-emotional learning is real. So grab your headsets and let’s explore!
